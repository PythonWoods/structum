# Welcome to Structum

**Structum** is a Python-based CLI tool designed to help developers visualize and document their project structures.

Whether you need a quick overview of a legacy codebase, a clean tree structure to paste into a `README.md`, or a way to feed file context to an LLM, Structum provides the tools to do it efficiently.

## Why Structum?

*   **Professional Output**: Move beyond the standard `tree` command with rich formatting and icons.
*   **Configurable**: Filter out noise (like `node_modules` or `__pycache__`) to focus on what matters.
*   **Integration Ready**: Designed to work within CI/CD pipelines and documentation workflows.
